  + 'fdr' function bug was fixed
  + addition of the 'randef' function
  + addition of the converter 'atcg1234' function 
  + names in the blup's or random effects added
  + zero-boundary constraint added to Average Information algorithm
     - it finds which var.comps are pushed to zero constantly
     - recalculates variance components removing such components 
     - fix those values and calculates the most likely value for 
       the problematic var.comp  
  + now 'mmer2' can handle missing data in explanatory variables as lmer
  + now summary of 'mmer2' has names in the variance components
  + A.mat, D.mat and E.mat supported for polyploids
  + mmer can run GWAS for polyploid organisms
     - the models implemented are the same than Rosyara (2016):
     - "additive","1-dom-alt","1-dom-ref","2-dom-alt","2-dom-ref"
  + eigen decomposition to accelarate genomic prediction based on Lee (2015)
    has been added in the argument 'MTG2' of the AI algorithm
