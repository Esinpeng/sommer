Do we live really rooted in the earth? 
Not forever on earth 
just a short time here. 
Even if jade... cracks, 
even if gold... breaks, 
even quetzal feathers torn. 
Not forever on earth. 
Just a short time here.\n 
Nezahualcoyotl\n\n"),

po3 <- c("\nThe present is alone. The memory
builds the time. Succession and deception
is the routine of the clock. The year
is no less vain than the vain history.

The face looking in the old         
mirrors of the night is not the same.
The transient today is tenuous and is eternal;
don't wait another Heaven, or another Hell.\n
JL Borges\n\n"),

po4 <- c("\nHave you seen how plants grow?
The place where the seed falls water goes:
is the water who germinates it, the sun rises.
Through the trunk, the branches, the water rises to the air,
like when you stare at the afternoon sky
and your eyes start to evaporate.

Plants grow overnight.
The earth is growing;
it becomes soft, green, flexible.\n
Jaime Sabines\n\n"),

po5 <- c("\nYesterday I was watching the animals and got to thinking about you.
Females are smoother, softer and more damaging.
Before surrendering, they damage the male, or flee, they defend themselves. Why?
I've seen you too, like pigeons,
burning up when I am calm.
Is that your blood and mine light up at different times?\n

-Different because we defend ourselves, Adam? I think we are weakest.
We are different because we want to change. We are better.
  
-I do not like to be better. I think we are missing something.
We are moving away from the wind. Among all the land
we will be strangers.
  
I remember the first skin you threw me over:
You took my skin off, made it useless.
We will end up being different from the stars
and no longer understand the trees.\n
Jaime Sabines\n\n"),

po7 <- c("\nThere is so much loneliness in that gold.
Tonight's moon is not the moon
that saw the first Adam. The long centuries
of human vigil have filled her
with old crying. Look at her. It is your mirror.\n
JL Borges\n\n"),

po8 <- c("\nDo not deceive your selves! 
the matter in hand relates to the greatest imaginable good. 
All the happiness of families depend upon the education of children: 
and houses rise or sink according as their children are virtuous or vicious.\n
Plato\n\n"),
